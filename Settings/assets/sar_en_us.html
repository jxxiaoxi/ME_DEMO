<h4 >THIS MOBILE PHONE MEETS THE GOVERNMENT’S REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPOSURE TO RADIO WAVES.
</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Your mobile phone is a radio transmitter and receiver. It is designed
and manufactured not to exceed the emission limits for exposure to
radio-frequency (RF) energy. These limits are part of comprehensive
guidelines and establish permitted levels of RF energy for the general
population. The guidelines are based on standards that were developed
by independent scientific organizations through periodic and thorough
evaluation of scientific studies. These guidelines include a substantial
safety margin designed to ensure the safety of all persons, regardless
of age and health.<br>
The exposure standard for mobile phones employs a unit of measurement
known as the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR.<br>
The SAR limit set by public authorities such as the Federal
Communications Commission of the US Government (FCC), or by
Industry Canada, is 1.6 W/kg averaged over 1 gram of body tissue.
Tests for SAR are conducted using standard operating positions with
the mobile phone transmitting at its highest certified power level in all
tested frequency bands.<br>
Although the SAR is determined at the highest certified power level, the
actual SAR level of the mobile phone while operating can be well below
the maximum value. This is because the mobile phone is designed to
operate at multiple power levels so as to use only the power required
to reach the network. In general, the closer you are to a wireless base
station antenna, the lower the power output of the mobile phone.
Before a mobile phone model is available for sale to the public,
compliance with national regulations and standards must be shown.<br>
The highest SAR value for this model mobile phone when tested is
0.266 W/kg for use at the ear and 0.614 W/kg for use close to the body.<br>
While there may be differences between the SAR levels of various
mobile phones and at various positions, they all meet the government
requirement for RF exposure. For body-worn operation, the mobile
phone meets FCC RF exposure guidelines provided that it is used with
a non-metallic accessory with the handset at least 15 mm from the
body. Use of other accessories may not ensure compliance with FCC
RF exposure guidelines.<br>
Additional information on SAR can be found on the Cellular
Telecommunications & Internet Association (CTIA) Web site: http://
www.phonefacts.net<br>
The World Health Organization (WHO) considers that present scientific
information does not indicate the need for any special precautions for
use of mobile phones. If individuals are concerned, they might choose to
limit their own or their children’s RF exposure by limiting the length of
calls, or using “hands-free” devices to keep mobile phones away from the
head and body. (fact sheet n°193).<br>
Additional WHO information about electromagnetic fields and public
health are available on the following website: http://www.who.int/

Note: This equipment has been tested and found to comply with the limits
for a Class B digital device pursuant to part 15 of the FCC Rules. These
limits are designed to provide reasonable protection against harmful
interference in a residential installation. This equipment generates, uses
and can radiate radio frequency energy and, if not installed and used in
accordance with the instructions, may cause harmful interference to
radio communications. However, there is no guarantee that interference
to radio or television reception, which can be determined by turning
the equipment off and on, the user is encouraged to try to correct the
interference by one or more of the following measures:<br>
- Reorient or relocate the receiving antenna.<br>
- Increase the separation between the equipment and receiver.<br>
- Connect the equipment into an outlet on a circuit different from that
to which the receiver is connected.<br>
- Consult the dealer or an experienced radio/ TV technician for
help. Changes or modifications not expressly approved by the party
responsible for compliance could void the user’s authority to operate
the equipment.<br>
For the receiver devices associated with the operation of a licensed radio
service (e.g. FM broadcast), they bear the following statement:<br>
This device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject
to the condition that this device does not cause harmful interference.
For other devices, they bear the following statement:<br>
This device complies with Part 15 of the FCC Rules. Operation is subject
to the following two conditions:<br>
(1) this device may not cause harmful interference<br>
(2) this device must accept any interference received, including
interference that may cause undesired operation.<br>
Your mobile phone is equipped with a built-in antenna. For optimal
operation, you should avoid touching it or degrading it.<br>
As mobile devices offer a range of functions, they can be used in positions
other than against your ear. In such circumstances the device will be
compliant with the guidelines when used with headset or USB data cable.
If you are using another accessory ensure that whatever product is used
is free of any metal and that it positions the mobile phone at least 15
mm away from the body.<br>
Specific Absorption Rate (ICNIRP)<br>
Proof of compliance with international standards (ICNIRP) or with
European Directive 1999/5/EC (R&TTE) is required of all mobile phone
models before they can be put on the market. The protection of the
health and safety for the user and any other person is an essential
requirement of these standards or this directive.
<br>THIS DEVICE MEETS INTERNATIONAL GUIDELINES FOR EXPOSURE
TO RADIO WAVES</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Your mobile device is a radio transmitter and receiver. It is designed
not to exceed the limits for exposure to radio waves (radio frequency
electromagnetic fields) recommended by international guidelines. The
guidelines were developed by an independent scientific organization
(ICNIRP) and include a substantial safety margin designed to assure the
safety of all persons, regardless of age and health.<br>
The radio wave exposure guidelines use a unit of measurement known
as the Specific Absorption Rate, or SAR. The SAR limit for mobile
devices is 2 W/kg.<br>
Tests for SAR are conducted using standard operating positions with
the device transmitting at its highest certified power level in all tested
frequency bands. The highest SAR values under the ICNIRP guidelines
for this device model are:
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
Maximum SAR for this model and conditions under which it
was recorded.<br>
Head SAR DCS 1800    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.167 W/kg<br>
Body-worn SAR WCDMA 900    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.449 W/kg<br>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
During use, the actual SAR values for this device are usually well below
the values stated above. This is because, for purposes of system efficiency
and to minimize interference on the network, the operating power of
your mobile device is automatically decreased when full power is not
needed for the call. The lower the power output of the device, the
lower its SAR value.<br>
Body-worn SAR testing has been carried out at a separation distance of
15 mm. To meet RF exposure guidelines during body-worn operation, the
device should be positioned at least this distance away from the body.
If you are not using an approved accessory ensure that whatever product
is used is free of any metal and that it positions the phone the indicated
distance away from the body.<br>
Organizations such as the World Health Organization and the US Food
and Drug Administration have stated that if people are concerned and
want to reduce their exposure they could use a hands-free device to
keep the phone away from the head and body during phone calls, or
reduce the amount of time spent on the phone.
